			README for SMOG2_tutorial


SMOG2_tutorial is a repository made to support everyone who wants to start
working with Structure-Based Models generated with SMOG 2 package.
More information about the SMOG 2 package, its manual, codes, and other examples
can be found at smog-server.org.

SMOG2_tutorial is an AGPL-3.0 licensed repository. See LICENSE for more details.

This distribution contains the input and some output files obtained while
simulating the Chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI-2) dynamics over a range of 
temperatures, to check some of its properties. 

The file "roadmap.txt" contains the set of commands to reproduce all the results.
These commands were used in a Linux-based system, though small
changes should be needed to use them in any Operational System. Each command (or
set of commands) is preceded by comments on how they operate or what should be 
expected from it/them.

The file "2ci2.pdb" is the CI-2 structure downloaded from the PDB web server 
without any change. The other PDB files are modified versions, obtained 
following the steps presented in the "roadmap.txt"

The folder AA contains all the input files used in the simulations. The force 
field files are there, with some output files acquired using the roadmap given. 
Most heavy files were not saved to save the repository space (XTC, TRR, EDR, 
and LOG files).

All comments, suggestions, questions, or feedback are welcomed. 
Please reach out through the repository channel or by e-mail.
