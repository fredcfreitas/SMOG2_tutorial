#### Roadmap:

# First we have to set some environmental variables

# For example: which command is used to call gromacs? If you are using an installation without MPI support, use "gmx". If you have MPI support, use "gmx_mpi", for example. In this case, it will be:

cmdgmx="gmx"

# Now, we have to set the number of OpenMP threads to be used. We are assuming simulations using one node/computer. If you are using a PC, the better option here is the default (0). In this case, it will use the number set by the environment variable OMP_NUM_THREADS, common in some clusters.

nompt=$OMP_NUM_THREADS

# The downloaded PDB file is called 2ci2.pdb. The file ci2-clean.pdb is derived from the original, with just the lines beginning with ATOM, TER, and END remaining. The other lines were deleted. The HETATM entries in this PDB are just some water molecules that will not be used in our simulations and were also deleted.

# In this step the cleaned PDB file will be adjusted. The smog_adjustPDB function, in its standard options, will change the residue names accordingly to the atom sequence, if any other map is provided. Other changes in the format will be made in order to make the output file more suitable to generate the force field. If needed, the atoms will be renumbered or TER lines will be added. None was needed in this case. The output is in the file "out-smog_adjustPDB.dat".

smog_adjustPDB -i ci2-clean.pdb -o ci2-adjusted.pdb > out-smog_adjustPBD.dat

# Now the force field will be generated for the All-atom model. The output is in the file "out-smog2-AA.dat"

smog2 -i ci2-adjusted.pdb -dname ci2-AA -AA &>> out-smog2-AA.dat


# Creating the folder to run the simulations and put all the force field files in it.

mkdir AA
mv ci2-AA* AA/
cd AA/

# From the ci2-AA.top file, extract the "[ pairs ]" section, and create the file.cont file. This file will be used as a reference to count the native contacts.


# Creating an initial file with the selected molecule (the "atom" beads, in this case), and enlarging the simulation box (to avoid hitting the boundaries during the simulations. 

$cmdgmx editconf -f ci2-AA.gro -c -d 10 -o ci2-AA-box.gro -bt cubic &>> out-editconf-AA.dat

# The file example.mdp is an example MDP file (MDP: Molecular Dynamics Parameters file) used in SMOG simulations. This file was created using the example found in the SMOG2 package and changing the number of simulated steps to TSTEPS and the temperature to TEMP. This will be used ahead.

# Here the folders and the MDP files for each temperature are created 

temperatures="80 90 100 110 120 130 140 150"
steps="10000000"

# In this step the temperature and the number of steps will be replaced in the MDP file, and the output will be saved in the correspondent folder.

# And execute it:
java -jar ~/proj-git/smog2/src/tools/WHAM.jar --config config_wham.txt 

# NOTE: $SMOG_FOLDER is the parent folder where your smog2 folder is placed. Please make sure to change this accordingly. 
# The WHAM.jar output files have the unbiased free energies for the selected temperatures (in the config_wham.txt file). Note also that the config_wham.txt file settings should reflect the values found in the e-Q.dat files. For example, the bin size and number of bins shall be chosen to cover the sampled range of each variable (energy and number of contacts). 
# To more details, check the SMOG2 manual at http://smog-server.org


# Checking the specific heat from the WHAM run, as the peak is around 122 and the free energies have not shown a smooth profile, the sampling around 122 may be improved.
